Take over the screen, print flickering random characters. Slowly make the piped content (or input file) visible.

Do this for example: tree ~/Downloads | ./decrypt.py
or jp2a my_favourite_cat.jpg --term-width | ./decrypt.py

Use cases:
Recover some friends hard drive (i.e.: he destroyed his mbr). After the "hard" work has been done, act like you are having a hard time and run some of his personal files through this program and ask if he recognizes the content.
Awesomeness guaranteed.
